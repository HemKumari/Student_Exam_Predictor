A simple, interactive Python program that predicts a student's final exam score based on their Mid-term 1 and Mid-term 2 scores — using **your real past results** only (no fake/sample data).

Built from scratch with:
- Linear Regression (gradient descent)
- Feature scaling (z-score normalization)
- No external ML libraries (only `numpy`)

## Features

- **Interactive menu** — no command line flags needed
- Add your own real past exam results
- View all entered records
- Train a linear regression model on your data
- Predict final scores for new mid-term marks
- Clear data & model when needed
- Saves data in CSV and model in JSON
- Shows basic performance metrics (MAE, RMSE, R²)
